# vweb-example

Example webapp with vweb (V integrated web framework)


## Setup and run

TODO ...


## Requirements

Latest V (vlang) built from sources, or later.


## Note

Current setup (and related commands) are for a Linux system, 
but can be updated for other platforms (Mac, Windows, etc).

Executable files generated from V code are very small, 
and by default all published web resources are bundled inside executables 
to simplify deploy.
