# vweb-example

Example webapp with vweb (V integrated web framework)


## Setup and run

TODO ...


## Requirements

Latest V (vlang) built from sources, or later.


## Note

Current setup (and related commands) are for a Linux system, 
but can be updated for other platforms (Mac, Windows, etc).

Executable files generated from V code are very small, 
and by default all published web resources are bundled inside executables 
to simplify deploy.

Just to have an idea, the minimal web server script ('server-minimal.v') 
when built on a moder Linux distribution (like Ubuntu 20.04 LTS at 64 bit) is:
- normal build: 365 KB
- optimized build (for production): 53 KB
and this is impressive.
